WhatsNext Vision Motors is revolutionizing its customer experience and operational efficiency with a cutting-edge Salesforce CRM implementation. The project streamlines the vehicle ordering process by auto-assigning orders to the nearest dealer based on customer location and preventing orders for out-of-stock vehicles. Automated workflows update order statuses dynamically and send scheduled email reminders for test drives. Key technical implementations include Apex triggers for stock validation, batch jobs for stock updates, and scheduled Apex for automated order processing. This initiative enhances customer satisfaction, improves order accuracy, and boosts overall operational efficiency.
